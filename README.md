# ReplaySeeker

## Disclaimer
Original Authors: Danat & DonTomaso
NOTE: I do not own any rights on this program, but since authors stopped developing this program for many years, i decided to decompile it and fix for newest Warcraft 3 versions.
I can delete this project if authors dont want it to be here. But we really need this one, we need it to be alive.

Somewhat changelog:

## 26.08.2017 
**Stable:**


- Small fixes
- Auto acquiring administrator access

## 23.08.2017
**Still beta:**


- Added turbo mode support for known versions (not sure about 1.28, cannot make a good test for it; investigating)
- Changed some calls to thread-safe ones
- Added simple version 'autodetect'
- Added known process names list, so no need to specify it anymore (in most cases)
- No need to restart ReplaySeeker for another replay/warcraft version anymore.
- Reworked 'rescan' button:
No more needed to click it to restart scan process. It will always do scan until it finds replay.
There are 'stop scan' button to stop it and get able to select another version if it is needed.

## 17.08.2017
**Still beta:**


- Added multiple versions support, ability to choice (1.26, 1.27, 1.28 are available now and should work)
- Implemented simple version of custom offsets setting (run ReplaySeeker once and look in the repseek.cfg file)


## 16.08.2017
**Beta version:**


- added progressbar for memory scanning progress
- added more information into main window
- started adding multiversioning support (currently supports 1.26a and 1.28+);


## 14.08.2017


- SimpleCamera is working too now
- Removed my tests from code
- Disabled 'Turbo' checkbox
- Fixed few crashes and bugs


## 13.08.2017


- Added decompiled sources
- ReplaySeeker is working now

HERE ARE SIMPLE README TEMPLATE THAT I HAVEN`T FINISHED CHANGING YET (no time atm):
